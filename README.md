## Introduction:

This project focuses on bank stocks to see how they progressed throughout the [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) all the way to early 2023.

## Purpose: 

In this data project I will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. This project is just meant to work with the capabilities of pandas and visualization in python related to stock and financial analysis, it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice.
The analyses include but not limited to:
* Exploratory Data Analysis 
* Different types of finance plots and analysis, such as calculating return value, analyzing risky stocks,Technical Analysis plots (Moving Average,Bollinger Bands, Candlesticks Chart) and so on
